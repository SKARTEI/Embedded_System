CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.13 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on the
Atmel STK600 development board, using
an ATxmega128A4U chip.

This program exceeds the allowed code size
of the Evaluation version.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A4U FLASH memory with
the contents of the \Exe\HID Generic.hex file.

The chip uses the internal 32 MHz RC oscillator,
adjusted and calibrated to 48 MHz using the
DFLL and USB Start Of Frame.
The CPU and Peripheral Clock frequency are set to 12 MHz.

The STK600-TQFP44 socket and STK600-RC044X-55 routing
cards are used for interfacing the chip with
the STK600.

In order to use this example, the 'Generic Hid Test.exe'
program must be launched on the PC.
This program requires the .NET framework 4.0 to be installed
on the computer.
It can be downloaded from:

Note: The source code for the 'Generic Hid Test.exe' program
is supplied only with the commercial versions of CodeVisionAVR.

The STK600 with the ATxmega128A4U chip, programmed with this
example's code, must be connected to an USB port of the PC.
The STK600's mini USB connector and an appropriate cable
must be used for this purpose.

The 'Generic Hid Test' program will display the report data
sent by the STK600 to the PC host.

Checking the LED boxes in the 'Generic Hid Test' program,
will send report data to the USB device and will light
the appropriate LEDs on the STK600 board.
The LEDs are connected to PORTA pin 0..7 outputs.
For this purpose use a 10 pin ribbon cable to connect
the PORTA and LED headers.
