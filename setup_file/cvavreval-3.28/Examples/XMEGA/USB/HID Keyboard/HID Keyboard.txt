CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.13 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on the
Atmel STK600 development board, using
an ATxmega128A4U chip.

This program exceeds the allowed code size
of the Evaluation version.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A4U FLASH memory with
the contents of the \Exe\HID Keyboard.hex file.

The chip uses the internal 32 MHz RC oscillator,
adjusted and calibrated to 48 MHz using the
DFLL and USB Start Of Frame.
The CPU and Peripheral Clock frequency are set to 12 MHz.

The STK600-TQFP44 socket and STK600-RC044X-55 routing
cards are used for interfacing the chip with
the STK600.

The LEDs are connected to PORTA pin 0..7 outputs.
For this purpose use a 10 pin ribbon cable to connect
the PORTA and LED headers.

The STK600 switches are connected to PORTC pin 0..7 inputs.
For this purpose use a 10 pin ribbon cable to connect
the PORTC and SWITCHES headers.

The STK600 with the ATxmega128A4U chip, programmed with this
example's code, must be connected to an USB port of the PC.
The STK600's mini USB connector and an appropriate cable
must be used for this purpose.

Open a new file in the CodeVisionAVR editor
and click with the mouse in the editor window,
so that the caret will displayed.

After the HID keyboard is detected by the PC,
pressing the switches SW0..SW7 on the STK600 board will
be translated to key inputs in the editor window:

SW0 -> 'a' or 'A'
SW1 -> 'b' or 'B'
SW2 -> 'c' or 'C'
SW3 -> 'd' or 'D'
SW4 -> 'e' or 'E'
SW5 -> 'f' or 'F'
SW6 -> 'g' or 'G'
SW7 -> toggle Caps Lock on/off.

Board's LEDs 0..4 will display the keyboard status.
