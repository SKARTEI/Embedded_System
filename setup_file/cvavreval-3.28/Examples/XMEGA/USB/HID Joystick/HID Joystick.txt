CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.13 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on the
Atmel STK600 development board, using
an ATxmega128A4U chip.

This program exceeds the allowed code size
of the Evaluation version.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A4U FLASH memory with
the contents of the \Exe\HID Joystick.hex file.

The chip uses the internal 32 MHz RC oscillator,
adjusted and calibrated to 48 MHz using the
DFLL and USB Start Of Frame.
The CPU and Peripheral Clock frequency are set to 12 MHz.

The STK600-TQFP44 socket and STK600-RC044X-55 routing
cards are used for interfacing the chip with
the STK600.

The LEDs are connected to PORTA pin 0..7 outputs.
For this purpose use a 10 pin ribbon cable to connect
the PORTA and LED headers.

The STK600 switches are connected to PORTC pin 0..7 inputs.
For this purpose use a 10 pin ribbon cable to connect
the PORTC and SWITCHES headers.

The STK600 with the ATxmega128A4U chip, programmed with this
example's code, must be connected to an USB port of the PC.
The STK600's mini USB connector and an appropriate cable
must be used for this purpose.

In order to use this example, the
'Joystick Test.exe' program must be
launched on the PC.

The 'Joystick Test' program will display the joystick
movements and button states, simulated by pressing the
switches SW0..SW7 on the STK600 board:

SW0 - Move joystick right
SW1 - Move joystick left
SW2 - Move joystick up
SW3 - Move joystick down
SW4 - Move joystick Z axis up
SW5 - Move joystick Z axis down
SW6 - Press joystick button 1
SW7 - Press joystick button 2
