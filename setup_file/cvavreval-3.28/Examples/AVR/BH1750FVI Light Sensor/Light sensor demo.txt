CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.26 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on an
Arduino UNO development board, using
an ATmega328P chip running at 16 MHz.

The sensor output is transmitted serially at a
Baud rate of 9600, 8N1 and can be displayed using
the CodeVisionAVR IDE Tools|Terminal.

A GY30 breakout board with a BH1750FVI light sensor is
used for the purpose of the demo.

The connections are:
GY30 - Arduino UNO
SDA  - A4 (SDA)
SCL  - A5 (SCL)
ADDR - GND
GND  - GND
VCC  - Arduino Power 5V

- Arduino's USB must be connected to one of the PC's USB ports.
- The Arduino Virtual Serial Port will be now listed in the
  Device Manager window under Ports (COM & LPT)
- Retain the COMn number of the serial port and go to
  the CodeVisionAVR IDE "Settings|Terminal" menu and set
  the Terminal to use this COM port
- In the Terminal settings specify the Baud rate: 9600
  and disable the "Append On Reception" options
- Start the CodeVisionAVR Terminal using the "Tools|Terminal"
  menu and click on the "Connect" button
- Go to "Project|Configure|After Build" and make sure that
  the Arduino Upload COM port matches the one listed in the
  Windows Device Manager for the Arduino UNO board
- Do Project|Build All.
