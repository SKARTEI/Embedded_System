CodeVisionAVR Compiler version 3.12 or later
is required.

The program is designed to be executed on the
Atmel AT90USBKEY development board, using
an AT90USB1287 chip running at 8.000000 MHz.

Interface 0 is used for the Mouse
and Interface 1 for the Joystick.

In order to use this example, the
'Joystick Test.exe' program must be
launched on the PC.

The AT90USBKEY, programmed with this example's
code, must be connected to an USB port of the PC.

The 'Joystick Test' program will display the
AT90USBKEY joystick movements.

The mouse cursor will be moved every 5 seconds in
a triangular shape shape, using the Timer 1
overflow interrupt.

The LED5.2, connected to PORTD bit 7 output,
will be lighted during mouse cursor movement.
