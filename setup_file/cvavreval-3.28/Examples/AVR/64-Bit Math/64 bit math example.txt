This example is designed to run on an Arduino UNO
development board with an ATmega328P chip
clocked at 16 MHz.

The sensor output is transmitted serially at a
Baud rate of 9600, 8N1 and can be displayed using
the CodeVisionAVR IDE Tools|Terminal.
  
The program size exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version.
In this case the pre-compiled executable from
\Examples\AVR\64-Bit Math\Release\Exe\64 bit math example.hex 
can be uploaded to the Arduino board.
