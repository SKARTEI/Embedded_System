The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlained development board with chip clock of 32 MHz.

A 96x64 color OLED display from LG Electronics Inc. 
color display module was used for the purpose of this demo.

The display module connections using the 8080 parallel interface are:
DB0    - PORTA bit 0
DB1    - PORTA bit 1
DB2    - PORTA bit 2
DB3    - PORTA bit 3
DB4    - PORTA bit 4
DB5    - PORTA bit 5
DB6    - PORTA bit 6
DB7    - PORTA bit 7

/RES   - PORTD bit 0
/CS    - PORTD bit 1
D/C    - PORTD bit 2
/RD    - PORTD bit 3
/WR    - PORTD bit 4

VSS    - GND
VDD    - +3.3V decoupled with 10uF/16V tantalum capacitor to GND
VCC    - +12V decoupled with 10uF/25V tantalum capacitor to GND

VCOMH  - decoupled with 4.7uF/16V tantalum capacitor to GND
IREF   - 820k resistor to GND

Set signals to use 8-bit 8080 parallel interface mode:
BS1    - +3.3V
BS2    - +3.3V

Make sure to specify the correct connections in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.

This program exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic Displays\SSD1332\Release\Exe\Full Demo.hex
file.
