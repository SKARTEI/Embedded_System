This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ra8875.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic Displays\RA8875\Release\Exe\demo_tft7.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A large portion of the program (51712 bytes)
consists of the uncompressed 186x139 64k color
image from the file image.c
Due to the limited number of I/O pins of the Xplained
board, there was no possibility to connect a SD CARD
and store this image on it, so for the purpose of this demo,
it was located in chip's FLASH memory.
The image was left uncompressed in order to allow fast loading.

In this demo the RA8875 controller operates in 
8 bit interface mode.
For better performance the 16 bit operating mode can
be selected by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
In this situation the DB8-DB15 signals must be also
connected to one of the ATxmega128A1 ports.   

A 800x480 7" type ER-TFTM070-5 TFT LCD module from 
East Rising Technology Co. Ltd. (http://www.buydisplay.com) 
is used for the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the RA8875 controller. 

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - PORTA bit 0
DB1  - PORTA bit 1
DB2  - PORTA bit 2
DB3  - PORTA bit 3
DB4  - PORTA bit 4
DB5  - PORTA bit 5
DB6  - PORTA bit 6
DB7  - PORTA bit 7

DB8  - GND
DB9  - GND
DB10 - GND
DB11 - GND
DB12 - GND
DB13 - GND
DB14 - GND
DB15 - GND

/CS    - PORTD bit 6
RS     - PORTD bit 7
/RD    - PORTD bit 2
/WR    - PORTD bit 3
/RESET - PORTD bit 4

BL_CONTROL - PORTD bit 5

VSS    - GND
VDD    - +5V (Jumper JP8 on the ER-TFTM070-5 must be OPEN)

The following jumpers must be set on the module:
J6, J9, J12, J13, J15

The following jumpers must be opened on the module:
J7, J8, J10, J11, J14, J16

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
