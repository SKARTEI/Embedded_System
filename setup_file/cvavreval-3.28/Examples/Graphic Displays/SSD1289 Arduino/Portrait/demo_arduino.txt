This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR,
because the glcd_ssd1289.lib file is supplied only with
the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATmega2560 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\SSD1289 Arduino\Exe\demo_8bit.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on an Arduino Mega2560
development board with an ATmega2560 chip using a
16 MHz crystal oscillator as clock source.

The SSD1289 TFT controller is used in an 8-bit bus
connection, 64k color mode.
This mode is supported only by CodeVisionAVR V3.15
or later compilers.

A "3.2" TFT Arduino TFT LCD Shield Rev. B" from:

http://www.uctronics.com/32-tft-lcd-shield-touch-panel-tf-reader-for-arduino-p-1111.html

is used for the purpose of this demo.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- Due to a design flaw in the Arduino Mega board,
you must cut the traces and insert two 10k SMD
resistors between the ATmega8U2 RXD (PORTD bit 3),
respectively TXD (PORTD bit 2), signals and the RN4B,
respectively RN4A, 1k resistors that lead to the
ATmega2560 PORTE bit 0, respectively PORTE bit 1 signals.
This way the total resistance between ATmega2560 PORTE bit 0,
respectively bit 1, and ATmega8U2 PORTD bit 3,
respectively bit 2, will be 11k.
Failure to do so, will result in the glcd_getpixel
and glcd_floodfill functions not working properly
with this TFT LCD shield.
- The DIP switches 1 and 2 on the TFT shield must be
set in the ON position.

The TFT LCD shield connections to the Arduino Mega2560 are:
D0 (TFT DB0) - PORTE bit 0
D1 (TFT DB1) - PORTE bit 1
D2 (TFT DB2) - PORTE bit 4
D3 (TFT DB3) - PORTE bit 5
D4 (TFT DB4) - PORTG bit 5
D5 (TFT DB5) - PORTE bit 3
D6 (TFT DB6) - PORTH bit 3
D7 (TFT DB7) - PORTH bit 4

A0 (TFT /CS) - PORTF bit 0
A1 (TFT D/C) - PORTF bit 1
A2 (TFT /WR) - PORTF bit 2
A3 (TFT /RD) - PORTF bit 3

GND   - Arduino Mega2560 GND
+5V   - Arduino Mega2560 +5V
+3.3V - Arduino Mega2560 +3.3V

The connections can be modified by accessing the
