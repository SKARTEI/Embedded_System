The demo is designed to run on an ATxmega128A1
XPlained development board with chip clock of 32 MHz.

An Univision Technology UG-9664HDDAG01 96x64 OLED 
color display module was used for the purpose of this demo.

The display module connections using the 8080 parallel interface are:
DB0    - PORTA bit 0
DB1    - PORTA bit 1
DB2    - PORTA bit 2
DB3    - PORTA bit 3
DB4    - PORTA bit 4
DB5    - PORTA bit 5
DB6    - PORTA bit 6
DB7    - PORTA bit 7

/RES   - PORTD bit 0
/CS    - PORTD bit 1
D/C    - PORTD bit 2
/RD    - PORTD bit 3
/WR    - PORTD bit 4

VSS    - GND
VDD    - +3.3V decoupled with 10uF/16V tantalum capacitor to GND
VDDIO  - +3.3V decoupled with 10uF/16V tantalum capacitor to GND
VCC    - +14V decoupled with 10uF/25V tantalum capacitor to GND

VCOMH  - decoupled with 4.7uF/16V tantalum capacitor to GND
IREF   - 1.2 Mohm resistor to GND

Set signals to use 8-bit 8080 parallel interface mode:
BS0    - +3.3V
BS1    - +3.3V

Make sure to specify the correct connections in the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
