This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the
glcd_st7789.lib file is supplied only with the
Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic Displays\ST7789\Portrait\Release\Exe\demo_portrait.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A type NHD-2.4-240320CF-CTXI#-F 240x320 2.4" TFT LCD
module from www.newhavendisplay.com
is used for the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the ST7789 controller.
The display is connected to the XMEGA-A1 Xplained
board using a NHD-FFC40 addapter, also from
www.newhavendisplay.com

In this demo the controller is operated in 64k color mode
using a 8 bit interface .

The TFT LCD module connections are:
14 DB0  - GND

35 LED-K2 - connected to GND using a 470 ohm resistor
36 LED-K3 - connected to GND using a 470 ohm resistor
37 LED-K4 - connected to GND using a 470 ohm resistor

Power supply connections:
7 VDD   - +3.3V
8 IOVDD - +3.3V
1  GND  - GND
33 GND  - GND
39 GND  - GND

If you are using a different TFT module,
please use the connections from the module's datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
