This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the glcd_ra8875.lib
file is supplied only with the Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic Displays\Capacitive Touchscreen\FT5206\Release\Exe\ct_demo.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

In this demo the RA8875 controller operates in 
8 bit interface mode.
For better performance the 16 bit operating mode can
be selected by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
In this situation the DB8-DB15 signals must be also
connected to one of the ATxmega128A1 ports.   

A 800x480 7" type ER-TFTM070-5 TFT LCD module from 
East Rising Technology Co. Ltd. (http://www.buydisplay.com) 
is used for the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the RA8875 TFT and FT5206 touchscreen controllers. 

The TFT display module connections are:
DB0      - PORTA bit 0
DB1      - PORTA bit 1
DB2      - PORTA bit 2
DB3      - PORTA bit 3
DB4      - PORTA bit 4
DB5      - PORTA bit 5
DB6      - PORTA bit 6
DB7      - PORTA bit 7

DB8      - GND, from from PORTA header pin 9 of 
                the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained board
DB9      - GND
DB10     - GND
DB11     - GND
DB12     - GND
DB13     - GND
DB14     - GND
DB15     - GND

/CS      - PORTD bit 6
RS       - PORTD bit 7
/RD      - PORTD bit 2
/WR      - PORTD bit 3
/RESET   - PORTD bit 4

FT5206 touchscreen controller signals:
CTP_SDA  - PORTD bit 0, has 10k pull-up resistor on the display board
CTP_SCL  - PORTD bit 1, has 10k pull-up resistor on the display board
CTP_WAKE - not connected, has 10k pull-up resistor on the display board
CTP_/RST - PORTD bit 4
CTP_/INT - PORTD bit 5

BL_CONTROL - 3.3V from PORTD header pin 10 of 
             the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained board
VSS        - GND from PORTD header pin 9 of
             the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained board
VDD        - +5V from external power supply 
             (Jumper JP8 on the ER-TFTM070-5 must be OPEN)

The following jumpers must be set on the module:
J6, J9, J12, J13, J15

The following jumpers must be opened on the module:
J7, J8, J10, J11, J14, J16

The TFT controller connections can be modified by accessing
the Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
