This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the
glcd_st7781.lib file is supplied only with the
Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1U FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic Displays\ST7781\Portrait\Exe\demo_portrait.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the STK600
development board with an ATxmega128A1U
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A 240x320 2.8" display module "TFT Lite"
from http://www.wide.hk is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the ST7781 controller.

In this demo the controller is operated in 64k color mode.

The TFT LCD module connections are:
D0   - PORTC bit 0
D1   - PORTC bit 1
D2   - PORTC bit 2
D3   - PORTC bit 3
D4   - PORTC bit 4
D5   - PORTC bit 5
D6   - PORTC bit 6
D7   - PORTC bit 7

D8   - PORTE bit 0
D9   - PORTE bit 1
D10  - PORTE bit 2
D11  - PORTE bit 3
D12  - PORTE bit 4
D13  - PORTE bit 5
D14  - PORTE bit 6
D15  - PORTE bit 7

/CS  - PORTF bit 0
RS   - PORTF bit 1
/RD  - PORTF bit 2
/WR  - PORTF bit 3
/RST - PORTF bit 4

Backlight control - PORTF bit 5

Power supply connections:
GND     - GND
VCC     - +5V 
Note: THERE IS A 3.3V REGULATOR ON THE "TFT Lite" MODULE 
FROM WWW.WIDE.HK, CHECK YOUR MODULE BEFORE USING

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic Display menu.
