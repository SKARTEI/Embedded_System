This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the
glcd_ili9341.lib file is supplied only with the
Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\ILI9341\SPI\64k Colors\Exe\demo_tft_spi_64k.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained
development board with an ATxmega128A1
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A type TM022HDH26 240x320 2.2" TFT LCD module from
SHANGHAI TIANMA MICRO-ELECTRONICS, mounted on
an addapter board, is used for the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the ILI9341 controller.

In this demo the controller is operated in 320x240
landscape 64k color mode, using the SPI peripheral
on PORTD.

The TFT LCD module connections are:
/RST - PORTD bit 2
RS (D/C) - PORTD bit 3
/CS  - PORTD bit 4
SDI  - PORTD bit 5
SDO  - PORTD bit 6
SCL  - PORTD bit 7

Backlight connection:
LED A - connected to +3.3V using a 10 ohm resistor

Power supply connections:
GND   - GND
VCC  - +3.3V (The 3.3V internal regulator on the module must 
              be disabled by shorting jumper JP1)

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
