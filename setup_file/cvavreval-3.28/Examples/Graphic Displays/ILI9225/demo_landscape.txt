This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the
glcd_ili9225.lib file is supplied only with the
Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic Displays\ILI9225\Release\Exe\demo_landscape.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the Atmel XMEGA-A1 Xplained
development board with an ATxmega128A1 chip using the internal 32 MHz
oscillator as clock source.

In this demo the ILI9225 TFT controller is operated in
landscape 220x176 mode, with 64k colours,
8-bit interface.

The TFT LCD module connections are:
DB0  - GND
DB1  - GND
DB2  - GND
DB3  - GND
DB4  - GND
DB5  - GND
DB6  - GND
DB7  - GND

DB8  - PORTA bit 0
DB9  - PORTA bit 1
DB10 - PORTA bit 2
DB11 - PORTA bit 3
DB12 - PORTA bit 4
DB13 - PORTA bit 5
DB14 - PORTA bit 6
DB15 - PORTA bit 7

/CS  - PORTD bit 0
RS   - PORTD bit 1
/RD  - PORTD bit 2
/WR  - PORTD bit 3
/RST - PORTD bit 4

If you are using a different LCD module,
please use the connections from the module datasheet.

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.
