This program can't be compiled with the Evaluation or
Standard versions of CodeVisionAVR, because the
glcd_ili9331.lib file is supplied only with the
Advanced license.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1U FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic Displays\ILI9331\Landscape\Exe\demo_landscape.hex
file.

The demo is designed to run on the STK600
development board with an ATxmega128A1U
chip using the internal 32 MHz oscillator
as clock source.

A 240x320 2.8" TFT LCD module is used for
the purpose of this demo.
It can be replaced with other similar modules with
the ILI9331 controller.

In this demo the controller is operated in
landscape 320x240 mode, with 64k colours.
